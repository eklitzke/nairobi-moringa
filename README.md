To create a PDF file, you will need a LaTeX installation.  Then run `make`, and
you should get an output file called `nairobi-moringa.pdf`.  You may have to
run the command twice to get correct pagination.

If you just want the generated PDF file, visit
[eklitzke.org/nairobi-moringa.pdf](https://eklitzke.org/nairobi-moringa.pdf).
